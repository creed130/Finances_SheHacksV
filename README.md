## Disclaimer for Software Engineering

I'm using this (Charlotte Reed) for an assignment in week 3 of Software Engineering for the NERC DTP.
We never finished this project, so the functionality is basic.

Unfortunately, it appears I deleted all my more recent coding assignments from my undergrad,
and all my more functional projects for research purposes are either on a private GitLab account
that I no longer have access to, or on a private server using data that isn't mine so I don't think
I can post it publicly, or already in a group repo with tests etc already establised.
So I'm instead using a 4-year old incomplete project :)
